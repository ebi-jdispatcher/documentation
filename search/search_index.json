All our resources can be accessed via the web interface or programmatically. Job Dispatcher also offers these resources behind the scenes to power several other popular services hosted at the EBI such as InterProScan, UniProt, Ensembl Genomes, etc. The team also provides Dbfetch , an easy way to retrieve entries from various databases at the EMBL-EBI in a consistent manner. Overview of the Job Dispatcher services accessible via webpage and programmatic interfaces. What does Job Dispatcher offer Bioinformatics tools Job Dispatcher provides integrated access to core bioinformatics applications. These include some of the most popular powerhouses in bioinformatics, from sequence similarity search applications, such as NCBI BLAST+ and FASTA, multiple sequence alignment and pairwise sequence alignment tools, such as Clustal Omega and Kalign, tools for functional annotation and prediction such as InterProScan 5, RNA analysis tools such as R2DT, to other sequence analysis utilities. Visual representations of tool results, as well as downloadable results files, are also provided to help the users understand the job outputs. Biological datasets Job Dispatcher provides more than 45,000 distinct sequence libraries from major database resources hosted at EMBL-EBI, including UniProtKB, ENA and Ensembl Genomes. These are available for search through sequence similarity search applications. These datasets can be retrieved with Dbfetch, which provides a common interface to database entry retrieval in a variety of different formats. Dbfetch provides all the sequence libraries available to search in Job Dispatcher, with addition of several metadata datasets, including EMDB, PDBe-KB, MEDLINE, NCBI Taxonomy, EDAM ontology and HGNC. Programmatic access to the tools and data In addition to the webforms available from the website and downloadable results files, Job Dispatcher tools and Dbfetch data, can be accessed and retrieved via RESTful APIs, giving full programmatic access to the tools and data. Learn more about this on the Programmatic access section. Training materials The Job Dispatcher team is involved various training events at EMBL-EBI throughout the year. See a list of webinars we delivered as part of EBI Train online : Webinar about sequence alignment tools Webinar about sequence similarity search Webinar about Dbfetch Webinar about Introduction to programmatic access Webinar about sequence analysis web services News and updates If you would like to keep up to date with developments within Job Dispatcher, please follow us on Twitter ( @ebi_jdispatcher ).

Alternativey, you can search for tools on the EMBL-EBI services page . Note that not all the tools listed in the EMBL-EBI services page are provided by Job Dispatcher. The Job Dispatcher homepage. Tool webforms Running a tool from the web form is a simple multiple steps process. Each tool has at least 2 steps, but most of them have more, based on the tool category: The first steps are usually where the user sets the tool input (e.g. provide your input protein/nucleotide sequences, specify the databases (in case of sequence similarity search). The input sequence should be in one of the tool-specified formats. You can either paste the sequence or use the file upload option. An example screenshot of a tool webform. In the following steps, the user has the possibility to change the default tool parameters. Click on \u2018More Options\u2019 to see all the parameters for that specific tool. Mouse over the parameters to get more information about the parameter and default values. And finally, the last step is always the tool submission step, where the user can specify a title to be associated with the results and an email address for email notification. Using the submit button will effectively submit the information specified previously in the form to launch the tool on the server. An example screenshot of a tool webform with expanded Parameters. Input validation When a job is submitted, the webform performs some basic validation, for example, to check if any input has been provided. Additional validation is performed on the backend server to fully validate the input. Tip Parameters are validated by the backend server prior to running the tool on our HPC and in the event of a missing or wrong combination of parameters, the user will be notified directly in the webform. In addition to input validation, note that there are input constraints that vary across different tools. These can be on the number of input sequences, file size, in the case that the input is provided as a file upload, as well as the parameter values. These usually depend on the context of other parameters, the input provided or the program or database selected. The server validation messages typically provide a good hint on what the issue might be. Warning There is a file size limit for each tool. If your input sequence exceeds the limit, you will need to download the tool and run it locally. Sequence databases Job Dispatcher provides more than 45,000 distinct sequence libraries from major database resources hosted at EMBL-EBI, including UniProtKB, ENA and Ensembl Genomes. These are available for search through sequence similarity search applications. A complete list of databases provided by Job Dispatcher is provided in the next section Available databases .

Each tool has its own limit, please refer to the relevant webform page for individual tools. The EBI service has limits and therefore a smaller number of very long sequences will often stop before an alignment is completed. Our tool algorithms are NOT intended to produce genome synteny maps. What input formats can I use? Each tool has different requirements, however GCG, FASTA, EMBL (Nucleotide only), GenBank, PIR, NBRF, PHYLIP or UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (Protein only) formats can be used in the majority of tools. Please refer to the individual tool input pages. Incorrect input format is one of the most common reasons for job failure. How do I download an alignment? The quickest way to download the alignment is to click the 'Download Alignment File' button in the alignments tab of the results. You can view all the files that are produced on the 'Results Summary' tab, which includes the tool output and any guide tree files as well as the alignment file. How do I save a coloured alignment? There are several ways in which to save your colour file. Most obvious is to screenshot the alignment from the output and print to pdf or save as a high res image. Once you have your results, select result summary and if your browser allows the link to Jalview, you can use this tool to present many colour formats and save as pdf, png, etc. If your browser does not allow the link you can go to the Jalview website and use the tool from there. The EMBOSS suite of tools includes Prettyplot which can be used to download, colour and save alignments to either pdf or png. We do not host this service at the EBI and are unable to provide user support for this. For more colouring options you could choose to run Mview How can I view a phylogenetic tree? The tree data can be saved by clicking the 'View Phylogetic Tree file' button or by clicking the tree link in the Results Summary tab. Using this data you can recreate the tree in any tree viewing software that takes Newick format tree data. The tree image cannot be saved directly as it is a dynamic java-driven interface, however you can take a screenshot and then save this in an image editing program, or as mentioned above use the tree data to recreate the tree in another tree viewing program and save it from there. How can I view my tree after I've downloaded it? The tree data is in the widely used Newick format, there are several online or standalone tree viewing programs available that can take this and recreate the tree from this data. What is a subsitution matrix? A substitution matrix describes the rate at which one character in a sequence changes to other character states over time, see more What is a distance matrix? Distance matrices are used in phylogeny as non-parametric distance methods and were originally applied to phenetic data using a matrix of pairwise distances. These distances are then reconciled to produce a tree (a phylogram , with informative branch lengths). See more . Which distance/substitution matrix should I use? There are several distance matrices that can be used (selected) when performing sequence search or sequence alignment. The most widely used distance (substitution) matrix is BLOSUM62, but PAM matrices are also popular. The following publication describes in depth what are the factors one should consider when choosing a substitution matrix: Pearson WR. Selecting the Right Similarity-Scoring Matrix. Current protocols in bioinformatics. 2013;43:3.5.1-3.5.9. doi:10.1002/0471250953.bi0305s43 . What does percentage identity refer to? The percent identity value is a single numeric score determined for each pair of aligned sequences. It measures the number of identical residues (\u201cmatches\u201d) in relation to the length of the alignment. As displayed in the matrix (PIM), real numbers show 2 decimal points. The number shows the % of difference between two sequences (although this might differ between different tree viewers). A score of 0.01 means that there is a difference of 1% between two sequences. Please note that different alignment programs might calculate and report sequence percentage identity in different ways. Typically the program developer/researcher had a particular view on how to treat gaps and other regions of the multiple sequence alignments. This publication by Raghava and Barton, 2006 tries to discuss how this might be an issue when interpreting PIM results. What are the meaning of the scores shown in a phylogenetic tree? The scores shown in a phylogenetic tree (or dendrogram) produced as the output of a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA), correspond to a sequence distance measure. In a way, the values shown in the phylogenetic tree (also) try to represent the \"length\" of the branches, which is indicative of the evolutionary distance between the sequences. Generally speaking, the way most MSA algorithms work is that each pair of input sequences is aligned, and used to compute the pairwise identity of the pair. During the construction of the tree, the algorithm takes the aligned sequences and builds a sequence distance matrix that is then used to arrive at an \"optimal\" tree by a clustering method, typically Neighbour-Joining (NJ) or UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean). Sequence identities are converted to a measure of distance. Finally, the distance matrix is converted to a tree using a clustering method (NJ or UPGMA). After progressive alignment and from the final multiple alignment, pairwise identities of each pair of sequences are computed again. This produces a new distance matrix, from which a new tree is estimated. The clustering algorithm used is often Neighbour-joining, and this is the tree which is provided as the output. The reliability of the clustering performed is tested statistically by a process called bootstrap, whereby the clustering is performed 100's or 1000's times, returning a measure of confidence.

(Information courtesy of Toby Gibson). The same symbols display for DNA/RNA alignments, so while * (asterisk) characters are still useful, the other characters should be ignored for DNA/RNA alignments. What do consensus symbols represent in a Pairwise Alignment? Pairwise sequence alignments are generated by tools such as EMBOSS Needle, Water, Stretcher and Matcher. The alignment markup highlights where the sequences mismatched, gapped, identical or similar. In general the markup line uses a space for a mismatch or a gap, '.' for any small positive score, ':' for a similarity which scores more than 1.0, and '|' for an identity where both sequences have the same residue regardless of its score ('W' matching 'W' scores much more than 'L' matching 'L' because a conserved tryptophan is more significant than a conserved leucine). The 'markx' set of alignment formats (produced by the FASTA suite of programs written by Bill Pearson) use '.' for similarity and ':' for an identity. The '|' character is not used. This was a design decision by Bill Pearson when he wrote the FASTA programs. A detailed overview of the different formats is provided in the EMBOSS documentation, which is available here What do upper and lower case letters represent in consensus results? Lower case characters are used for unaligned residues. More information is available in this publication . How can I view my resulting multiple sequence alignment (MSA) with Jalview? Jalview is a free program for multiple sequence alignment editing, visualisation and analysis. Jalview has been developed in the Barton Group at the University of Dundee, and can be used to view and edit sequence alignments, analyse them with phylogenetic trees and principal components analysis (PCA) plots and explore molecular structures and annotation. To launch Jalview from the Multiple Sequence Alignment result page, click on the Jalview Logo provided in the \"Result Viewers\" tab of the results pages. A file named \"lauchJalview.jvl\" will be downloaded automatically. In order to open the downloaded application you need to either install an installer available here and this will load your MSA results or launch Jalview manually.

Pubmed: 19151095 DOI: doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btp033 What do gap penalties (Gap Opening, Gap Extension, etc.) correspond to? Gap penalties generally refer to the penalty that is subtracted from the alignment score that is computed during the sequence alignment set as performed by multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and pairwise sequence alignment (PSA) programs. For example, Clustal Omega defines Gap Opening Penalty has the penalty for opening a gap in the alignment, which makes the gaps less frequent for increasing gap opening values. Gap Extension Penalty corresponds to the penalty for extending a gap by one residue. Increasing this value will make the gaps shorter. There are some MSA programs that also define Terminal Gap penalties (example Kalign ), which correspond to the penalty of adding additional gaps at the C- or N-terminus of the sequences. Each tool has its own Gap penalty implementation and thresholds, please refer to the relevant webform or webservices page for individual tools. What is the difference between Global Alignment and Local Alignment Tools? Global alignment alignment tools create an end-to-end alignment of the sequences to be aligned, whereas, local alignment tools find one, or more, alignments describing the most similar region(s) within the sequences to be aligned.

Multiple sequence alignment is also an important step for phylogenetic analysis, which aims to model the substitutions that have occured over evolution and derive the evolutionary relationships between sequences. Clustal Omega improves on ClustalW in a number of ways - alignment accuracy and improved scaling to many sequences are the main results. How can I use Clustal Omega? The Clustal Omega multiple sequence alignment web form is available here . There are two ways to use this service at EMBL-EBI. The first is interactively (default) and the second is by email. Using it interactively, the user must wait for the results to be displayed in the browser window. The email option means that the results will not be displayed in the browser window but instead a link to the results will be sent by email. The email option is the better one to take when submitting large amounts of data or a job that might take a long time to run. What version of Clustal Omega is run at EMBL-EBI? For the precise version number of Clustal Omega being run please go to the submission details tab from your job results. How do I reference use of Clustal Omega at EMBL-EBI? Please cite use of Clustal Omega with the following: Fast, scalable generation of high-quality protein multiple sequence alignments using Clustal Omega Sievers F, Wilm A, Dineen DG, Gibson TJ, Karplus K, Li W, Lopez R, McWilliam H, Remmert M, S\u00f6ding J, Thompson JD, Higgins D Molecular Systems Biology 7 Article number: 539 doi:10.1038/msb.2011.75 A new bioinformatics analysis tools framework at EMBL-EBI (2010) Goujon M, McWilliam H, Li W, Valentin F, Squizzato S, Paern J, Lopez R Nucleic acids research 2010 Jul, 38 Suppl: W695-9 doi:10.1093/nar/gkq313 Programmatic use via Web Services should cite: Search and sequence analysis tools services from EMBL-EBI in 2022.

The program accepts nucleic acid or protein sequences, in the following multiple sequence formats: NBRF/PIR EMBL/UniProt Pearson (FASTA) GDE ALN/Clustal GCG/MSF RSF Please note raw sequence data (just the sequence with no recognised formatting) will not work with Clustal Omega. If using sequences from NCBI we recommend saving them as FASTA format first. Sequence format conversion tools are available [here] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/sfc/). Very long or badly aligning nucleotide sequences (so that the alignment approaches 100k characters in length) may cause Clustal Omega to fail. The sequences can either be pasted into the web form or uploaded to the web form in a file. It is very important that each of the sequences has a unique name. If they do not, the program will fail. There must be no empty lines, white spaces or control characters between sequences or at the top of the file. This will also cause the program to fail. How do I input multiple sequences into a single box? Paste the sequences in an accepted format into the same box: Clustal Omega accepts multiple sequence formats as input - these formats allow for multiple sequences to be placed in the same file or input box, as they each contain ways for Clustal Omega to distinguish where new sequences start. It is important to use correctly formated sequences for this reason. Is there a limit on the number of sequences or the size of the file that I submit to Clustal Omega? The input for Clustal Omega is limited to a maximum of 4000 sequences or to a 4MB file (whichever is smaller). If you need to align higher than this number of sequences/a larger file we recommended you download Clustal Omega and run it locally. When the input file or the number of sequences is large, Clustal Omega can run for days and in some cases may not finish at all - we recommend use of the email results option for long running jobs. To use Clustal Omega in a batch/scripted fashion please see our programmatic accss page What does a 'stream closed' error mean? This error sometimes occurs if you try to upload a really large input to our tools, far in excess of the limits described above. Make sure your input falls within the previously described limits. Where can I find information on the different parameters/options? To view parameter settings for Clustal Omega click the 'More options' buttons. Clicking on the parameter name will take you to the relevant help information. What substitution matrix/default parameters are used by Clustal Omega? Clustal Omega uses the HHalign algorithm and its default settings as its core alignment engine. The algorithm is described in S\u00f6ding, J. (2005) 'Protein homology detection by HMM\u2013HMM comparison'. Bioinformatics 21, 951-960. The default transition matrix is Gonnet, gap opening penalty is 6 bits, gap extension is 1 bit. What are the best settings for aligning two sequences? Trick question! Multiple sequence alignment tools like Clustal Omega are designed to align three or more sequences. To align two sequences you should use our pairwise alignment tools Why do I get a 'minimum 2 sequences required' error? This occurs when something is wrong with your sequence input. It is often caused by using a sequence format not supported by Clustal Omega, or a problem with the formatting for example sequence data not being on a newline from the sequence header line. Clustal Omega requires sequences to be formatted, not just raw sequence data. Information about sequence formats can be found at the EMBOSS sequence formats guide . If you're not sure, try using FASTA format. Sequence format conversion tools are available here . Why do I get a 'Two sequences cannot share the same identifier' error? Clustal Omega needs unique sequence identifiers, which it defines as the first word on the sequence identifier line. Check that you've not got a duplicate identifier somewhere in the input, that you're not using spaces or tabs in your identifiers, and that the first 30 characters of your identifier are unique if using Clustal format files. What does 'Entry found which does not contain a sequence' mean? Clustal Omega produces this error when it can't find the sequence data to go with a sequence identifier. This can happen if sequence data is missing from the input or the data is on the same line as the header - make sure the sequence data is on a new line. Why does Clustal Omega truncate my identifier? The default output format (ALN/Clustal format) truncates sequence identifiers to 30 characters - this may also affect the ability of the job to run if the first 30 characters are not unique. The PHYLIP format truncates even more restrictively, to 10 characters. To prevent truncation change the output format to a type that does not have a limit, such as pearson/FASTA. What outputs does Clustal Omega produce? Clustal Omega produces several outputs, depending on the options you selected when submitting the job. By default the main output is the alignment file. A simple phylogenetic tree (via neighbour joining) can be found in the Phylogenetic Tree tab. A pairwise identity scores matrix and other outputs can be viewed/downloaded in the Results Summary tab. How do I see alignments with numbers? By default, Clustal Omega outputs Clustal format alignments without numbering, to change this simply click 'more options' and change the output alignment format to 'Clustal w/ numbers'. How do I download the alignment? The quickest way to download the alignment is to click the 'Download Alignment File' button in the alignments tab of the results. You can view all the files that are produced on the 'Results Summary' tab, which includes the tool output and any guide tree files as well as the alignment file. Colours are not saved as part of the alignment. How can I view my alignment after I've downloaded it? The alignment will be in the format you specified in the input section, or Clustal by default if you didn't specify anything. They are all text files, so can be opened in any text viewing program that can deal with unix text characters (end of line characters for example). In Windows you can use NotePad. More specialist tools are available to investigate alignments and allow you to mark them up with colours for example. Genedoc and Jalview are two such tools. Why are there no pairwise scores for Clustal Omega? Clustal Omega uses a different method to calculate the guide tree compared to ClustalW, so we do not output the rough all-against-all pairwise alignment scores used to guide the alignment (as they don't exist). However we do calculate a pairwise identity matrix from the results, which can be downloaded from the Results Summary tab. How do I see the guide tree for Clustal Omega? By default Clustal Omega uses a sampling method called mBed to speed up the guide tree calculations so a traditional tree is not shown. To create a phylogenetic tree go to the Phylogenetic Tree tab in the results. How do I download/save the phylogenetic tree? The tree data can be saved by clicking the 'View Phylogetic Tree file' button or by clicking the tree link in the Results Summary tab. Using this data you can recreate the tree in any tree viewing software that takes Newick format tree data. The tree image cannot be saved directly as it is a dynamic java-driven interface, however you can take a screenshot and then save this in an image editing program, or as mentioned above use the tree data to recreate the tree in another tree viewing program and save it from there. How can I view my tree after I've downloaded it? The tree data is in the widely used Newick format, there are several online or standalone tree viewing programs available that can take this and recreate the tree from this data. How long are results stored at EMBL-EBI? Results are stored at EMBL-EBI for a week from the date of job submission and can be accessed via https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/services/web/toolresult.ebi?jobId= . What do the consensus symbols mean in the alignment? An * (asterisk) indicates positions which have a single, fully conserved residue. A : (colon) indicates conservation between groups of strongly similar properties as below - roughly equivalent to scoring > 0.5 in the Gonnet PAM 250 matrix: STA NEQK NHQK NDEQ QHRK MILV MILF HY FYW A . (period) indicates conservation between groups of weakly similar properties as below - roughly equivalent to scoring =< 0.5 and > 0 in the Gonnet PAM 250 matrix: CSA ATV SAG STNK STPA SGND SNDEQK NDEQHK NEQHRK FVLIM HFY Note that TV is included in the weaker scoring groups despite scoring 0.0 in the PAM 250 matrix, this is because it is a fairly common substitution as they are both beta-branched. In fully buried residues that is at the cost of a hydrogen bond. In fact, being relatively gentle, this substitution has been used in the past to make TS mutants. (Information courtesy of Toby Gibson). The same symbols display for DNA/RNA alignments, so while * (asterisk) characters are still useful, the other characters should be ignored for DNA/RNA alignments. Why do I get a 'Raw Tool Output' page? This happens when we can't parse the results of your Clustal Omega job - usually because the job has failed for some reason. Have a look at the links on the page, especially the Tool Error Details, for clues as to why this might have happened, and check your input for errors. Why do I get a 'Job not found' page? This happens when we can't find the job that you have requested. Normally it's a result of trying to look at the page over a week after the job was submitted, so the data is no longer available at EMBL-EBI. If you've copied the URL from a recent email job, check for any mistakes in the link. Why do I see 'Java is required'? Some of the options for Clustal Omega results pages require Java to work properly. If Java isn't installed with your browser or it doesn't have permission to run (for example it has been disabled due to being out of date) then there may be some results options missing, for example the button to launch Jalview or the display of trees. To update your version of Java go to the Java.com download page . What does the 'Error. Click' message mean in the Jalview box? Jalview relies on Java, which requires that applications present correct certificates for security reasons. If the Jalview program doesn't have a currently valid certificate then it will be prevented from running and this error will remain until we recieve an update from the author. To still run Jalview with this error you will need to go to the Jalview website and run the desktop version of the program. Top How to interpret the resultant tree? The values shown in the tree represent the \"length\" of the branches, which is an indication for evolutionary distance between the sequence, i.e these numbers represent the amount of genetic change.Generally, the larger the number, the larger the amount of genetic change. During the construction of the tree, the algorithm takes the aligned sequences and builds a sequence distance matrix that is then used to arrive at an \"optimal\" tree by a clustering method. The workflow will be like Unaligned sequences->Clustal Omega->Aligned sequences->Clustal Phylogeny->Phylogenetic tree + PIM","title":"Clustal Omega FAQs"},{"location":"faqs/clustal/#why-is-clustal-omega-useful","text":"Aligning multiple sequences highlights areas of similarity which may be associated with specific features that have been more highly conserved than other regions.

FASTM is a sequence similarity search tool that searches a database using local alignments to a collection of fragments. Why is FASTM useful? Finding existing database entries that are homologous with your query sequence makes it possible to transfer information to your query sequence. This can be useful when annotating genomes, predicting protein function, characterising protein families and exploring distant evolutionary relationships for example. How can I use FASTM? The FASTM web form is available here . There are two ways to use this service at EMBL-EBI. The first is interactively (default) and the second is by email. Using it interactively, the user must wait for the results to be displayed in the browser window. The email option means that the results will not be displayed in the browser window but instead a link to the results will be sent by email. The email option is the better one to take when submitting large amounts of data or a job that might take a long time to run. What version of FASTM is run at EMBL-EBI? For the precise version number please see the submission details tab in your job results. How do I reference use of FASTM at EMBL-EBI? Please cite use of FASTM at our website with the following: Getting more from less: algorithms for rapid protein identification with multiple short peptide sequences.(2002)Mackey AJ, Haystead TA, Pearson WRMolecular & Cellular Proteomics : MCP [2002, 1(2):139-147] doi: 10.1074/mcp.M100004-MCP200 A new bioinformatics analysis tools framework at EMBL-EBI (2010)Goujon M, McWilliam H, Li W, Valentin F, Squizzato S, Paern J, Lopez RNucleic acids research 2010 Jul, 38 Suppl: W695-9 doi:10.1093/nar/gkq313 What inputs does FASTM accept? The program accepts a single sequence file of a modified FASTA sequence format. This comprises a FASTA header line with an identifier for the set of sequences and optionally a description, followed by the individual sequences each starting on a newline and separated with commas. The sequence can either be pasted into the web form or uploaded to the web form in a file. Is there a limit on the number of sequences or the size of the file that I submit to FASTM? The input for FASTM is limited to a single sequence file with a maximum of 1MB data. If you want to run several sequences you can script batch runs of FASTM using our web services Where can I find information on the different parameters/options? To view parameter settings for FASTM click the 'More options' buttons. Clicking on the parameter name will take you to the relevant help information. What outputs does FASTM produce? The main FASTM output is the table of database hits and this is shown as the Summary Table tab. The raw output from the FASTM tool can be found in the Tool Output tab. The Visual Output tab gives a visual representation of the results, which helps identify which region in both your query sequence and the database sequence (subject) is aligning. For alignments against protein databases, the Functional Predictions tab scans all the database sequence results for hits against the InterPro collection of motif and families databases, as well as showing the region of alignment. How do I download the results? There are several downloads that are possible from FASTM. The simplest download is probably the Tool Output which can be downloaded as a text or XML file containing the hits and scores. From the Summary Table it is possible to download a file containing the sequence entries (only) that have been selected from the results using the download button. Buttons from the tabs with images can be used to download either a scalable vector graphics format file, or you can right click on any image to save it as a PNG format file. How can I view my results after I've downloaded them? Alignments/output saved as a text file can be opened in most text viewing/processing programs. XML output can be viewed in most browsers or imported into spreadsheet programs. PNG files can be viewed by image viewers or web browsers. SVG files might require more advanced image editors to view. I'm using Internet Explorer 9 and why aren't my button presses working? Unfortunately there is a compatibility problem with Internet Explorer 9 and some of the ways we create drop down menus on our website. This has the occasional side effect of making it impossible to click on buttons for example to change to a different results tab, or show colours. If you experience difficulties we recommend firstly trying the compatibility view icon on the URL bar of Internet Explorer. If this doesn't work please try another browser. How do the fixed scale/dynamic scale options work in the visual results? Fixed scale produces a bar with an Expect score from 0 to 100. Dynamic sets the left most of the bar to the smallest Expect score seen in the results, to the right most of the largest Expect score seen. How long are results stored at EMBL-EBI? Results are stored at EMBL-EBI for a week from the date of job submission. What do the alignment symbols mean? The exact format depends on the format selected on the input form, but by default: : (colon) represents an identical match . (period) represents a similar match (BLOSUM50 value greater than or equal to 0) - (hyphen) represents a gap in the sequence X represents part of the sequence that was filtered for low complexity.

Paste the sequences in an accepted format into the same box: Simple Phylogeny accepts multiple sequence formats as input - these formats allow for multiple sequences to be placed in the same file or input box, as they each contain ways for Simple Phylogeny to distinguish where new sequences start. It is important to use correctly formated sequences for this reason. Is there a limit on the number of sequences or the size of the file that I submit to Simple Phylogeny? The input for Simple Phylogeny is limited to a maximum of 500 sequences or to a 1MB file (whichever is smaller). When the input file or the number of sequences is large, Simple Phylogeny can run for days and in some cases may not finish at all. If you plan to input large amounts of data/sequences you should use the email results option. For batch runs of Simple Phylogeny see our programmatic access page . Where can I find information on the different parameters/options? The parameter settings are in the box below the sequence input. Clicking on the parameter name will take you to the relevant help information. Why do I get a 'minimum 2 sequences required' error? This occurs when something is wrong with your sequence input. It is often caused by using a sequence format not supported by Simple Phylogeny, or a problem with the formatting for example sequence data not being on a newline from the sequence header line. Simple Phylogeny requires sequences to be formatted, not just raw sequence data. Information about sequence formats can be found at the EMBOSS sequence formats guide . If you're not sure, try using FASTA format. You can also use tools like Readseq to convert between sequence formats. top Why do I get a 'Two sequences cannot share the same identifier' error? Simple Phylogeny needs unique sequence identifiers, which it defines as the first word on the sequence identifier line. Check that you've not got a duplicate identifier somewhere in the input, that you're not using spaces or tabs in your identifiers, and that the first 30 characters of your identifier are unique if using Clustal format files. What does 'Entry found which does not contain a sequence' mean? Simple Phylogeny produces this error when it can't find the sequence data to go with a sequence identifier. This can happen if sequence data is missing from the input or the data is on the same line as the header - make sure the sequence data is on a new line. Why does Simple Phylogeny truncate my identifier? Clustal file format (.aln) truncates sequence identifiers to 30 characters - this may also affect the ability of the job to run if the first 30 characters are not unique. How can I apply distance correction to my tree? By default no distance correction is applied. Using the 'Distance Correction' option you can apply distance correction to phylogenetic trees. The distance correction method is Kimura: A simple method for estimating evolutionary rates of base substitutions through comparative studies of nucleotide sequences.(1980)Kimura MJournal of Molecular Evolution 1980 16:111120. More information about this and other evolutionary models for DNA substitution can be found at Wikipedia: Models of DNA evolution, Kimura . What outputs does Simple Phylogeny produce? Simple Phylogeny produces several outputs, depending on the options you selected when submitting the job. By default the main output is a phylogenetic tree, with both the tree data (Newick format) and an image representation of the tree. Other outputs can be viewed/downloaded in the results summary tab. How do I download/save the phylogenetic tree? The tree data can be saved by clicking the 'View Phylogetic Tree file' button or by clicking the tree link in the Results Summary tab. Using this data you can recreate the tree in any tree viewing software that takes Newick format tree data. The tree image cannot be saved directly as it is a dynamic Java-driven interface, however you can take a screenshot and then save this in an image editing program, or as mentioned above use the tree data to recreate the tree in another tree viewing program and save it from there. How can I view my tree after I've downloaded it? The tree data is in the widely used Newick format, there are several online or standalone tree viewing programs available that can take this and recreate the tree from this data. I'm using Internet Explorer 9 and why aren't my button presses working? Unfortunately there is a compatibility problem with Internet Explorer 9 and some of the ways we create drop down menus on our website. This has the occasional side effect of making it impossible to click on buttons for example to change to a different results tab, or show colours. If you experience difficulties we recommend firstly trying the compatibility view icon on the URL bar of Internet Explorer. If this doesn't work please try another browser. How can I see distance values/branch lengths on my tree? Unfortunately we can't display a scale bar or branch lengths on the branches themselves, however the show distances button will add distance values to the node label. These show the length of the branch immediately leading to the node. Interbranch distances are not shown on the tree, but can be seen in the tree data file. What units are the distance values? The distance values show the number of substitutions (nucleotides or amino acid residues) as a proportion of the length of the alignment (excluding gaps). These numbers represent the amount of genetic change.Generally, the larger the number, the larger the amount of genetic change. Can I add bootstrap values to my tree? We do not allow bootstrap analysis of phylogenetic trees for throughput reasons. If you wish to perform a more rigorous phylogenetic analysis we recommend using a different tool. What is the difference between a cladogram and a phylogram? A phylogram is a branching diagram (tree) that is assumed to be an estimate of a phylogeny. The branch lengths are proportional to the amount of inferred evolutionary change. A cladogram is a branching diagram (tree) assumed to be an estimate of a phylogeny where the branches are of equal length. Therefore, cladograms show common ancestry, but do not indicate the amount of evolutionary \"time\" separating taxa. It is possible to see the tree distances by clicking on the diagram to get a menu of options. The options available allow you to do things like changing the colours of lines and fonts and showing the distances. How long are results stored at EMBL-EBI? Results are stored at EMBL-EBI for a week from the date of job submission. Why do I get a 'Raw Tool Output' page? This happens when we can't parse the results of your Simple Phylogeny job - usually because the job has failed for some reason. Have a look at the links on the page, especially the Tool Error Details, for clues as to why this might have happened, and check your input for errors. Why do I get a 'Job not found' page? This happens when we can't find the job that you have requested. Normally it's a result of trying to look at the page over a week after the job was submitted, so the data is no longer available at EMBL-EBI. If you've copied the URL from a recent email job, check for any mistakes in the link. Why do I see 'Java is required'? The phylogenetic tree representation requires Java to work properly. If Java isn't installed with your browser or it doesn't have permission to run (for example it has been disabled due to being out of date) then there may be some results options missing. To update your version of Java go to the Java.com download page .","title":"Simple Phylogeny FAQs"},{"location":"faqs/phylogeny/#simple-phylogeny-faqs","text":"","title":"Simple Phylogeny FAQs"},{"location":"faqs/phylogeny/#what-is-simple-phylogeny","text":"Simple Phylogeny is a tool to perform basic phylogenetic analysis on a multiple sequence alignment.","title":"What is Simple Phylogeny?"},{"location":"faqs/phylogeny/#why-is-simple-phylogeny-useful","text":"Phylogenetics aims to model the substitutions that have occured over evolutionary time and derive and represent the evolutionary relationships between sequences.","title":"Why is Simple Phylogeny useful?"},{"location":"faqs/phylogeny/#how-can-i-use-simple-phylogeny","text":"The Simple Phylogeny web form is available here .

PSI-Search is a sequence similarity search tool that combines the sensitivity of the Smith-Waterman search algorithm (SSEARCH) with the PSI-BLAST profile construction strategy to find distantly related protein sequences in our protein databases. Why is PSI-Search useful? Finding existing database entries that are homologous with your query sequence makes it possible to transfer information to your query sequence. This can be useful when annotating genomes, predicting protein function, characterising protein families and exploring distant evolutionary relationships for example. What is Homologous Over-Extension (HOE)? Homologous Over-Extension, or HOE, is one of the main causes of PSSM corruption in iterative searches, which can result in database hits being labelled as statistically valid when they are unrelated to your query sequence. PSI-Search at EMBL-EMBL-EBI incorporates an option (enabled by default) to reduce the likelihood of this occuring, by masking the alignment boundaries. For more information about HOE errors please see the following paper: Homologous over-extension: a challenge for iterative similarity searches (2010)Gonzalez MW and Pearson WRNucleic Acids Res. 2010 April; 38(7): 2177\u20132189. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkp1219 How can I use PSI-Search? The PSI-Search web form is available here . There are two ways to use this service at EMBL-EBI. The first is interactively (default) and the second is by email. Using it interactively, the user must wait for the results to be displayed in the browser window. The email option means that the results will not be displayed in the browser window but instead a link to the results will be sent by email. The email option is the better one to take when submitting large amounts of data or a job that might take a long time to run. PSI-Search runs a little differently to non-iterative search methods. The first run is no different to a SSEARCH similarity search - this search is used to find sequences which can be used to build the PSSM. Once sequences have been selected for inclusion in the PSSM the next run (first iteration), initated by pressing the \"Run next iteraction\" button, will build a PSSM from these selections and PSI-Search will conduct a search using this PSSM. The results from this iteration can themselves be used to construct a new PSSM and another search. What version of PSI-Search is run at EMBL-EBI? For the precise version number please see the submission details tab in your job results. How do I reference use of PSI-Search at EMBL-EBI? Please cite use of PSI-Search at our website with the following: PSI-Search: iterative HOE-reduced profile SSEARCH searching(2012)Li W, McWilliam H, Goujon M, Cowley A, Lopez R and Pearson WRBioinformatics (2012) 28 (12): 1650-1651. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/bts240 A new bioinformatics analysis tools framework at EMBL-EBI (2010)Goujon M, McWilliam H, Li W, Valentin F, Squizzato S, Paern J, Lopez RNucleic acids research 2010 Jul, 38 Suppl: W695-9 doi:10.1093/nar/gkq313 What inputs does PSI-Search accept? The program accepts a single protein sequence in a recognised sequence format. The full list of sequence formats accepted as input is given in this table: EMBOSS sequence formats but please note that PSI-Search does not accept sequences with STOP characters ( * ) present. The sequence can either be pasted into the web form or uploaded to the web form in a file. Is there a limit on the number of sequences or the size of the file that I submit to PSI-Search? The input for PSI-Search is limited to a single sequence with a maximum of 1MB data. If you want to run several sequences you can script batch runs of PSI-Search using our web services Where can I find information on the different parameters/options? To view parameter settings for PSI-Search click the 'More options' buttons. Clicking on the parameter name will take you to the relevant help information. What outputs does PSI-Search produce? The main PSI-Search output is the table of database hits and this is shown as the Summary Table tab. The raw output from the PSI-Search tool can be found in the Tool Output tab. The Visual Output tab gives a visual representation of the results, which helps identify which region in both your query sequence and the database sequence (subject) is aligning. The Functional Predictions tab scans all the database sequence results for hits against the InterPro collection of motif and families databases, as well as showing the region of alignment. Finally, the PSSM file is also output from any iteration where one has been generated. How do I download the results? There are several downloads that are possible from PSI-Search. The simplest download is probably the Tool Output which can be downloaded as a text or XML file containing the hits and scores. From the Summary Table it is possible to download a file containing the sequence entries (only) that have been selected from the results using the download button. Buttons from the tabs with images can be used to download either a scalable vector graphics format file, or you can right click on any image to save it as a PNG format file. How can I view my results after I've downloaded them? Alignments/output saved as a text file can be opened in most text viewing/processing programs. XML output can be viewed in most browsers or imported into spreadsheet programs. PNG files can be viewed by image viewers or web browsers. SVG files might require more advanced image editors to view. Why don't I get a PSSM after the first run of PSI-Search? The first run of PSI-Search is just like running a SSEARCH - you need this initial run in order to select the results from which the PSSM will be built. The next run is the first iteration that uses a PSSM and the Summary Table tab from those results will include a link to the PSSM file that was used to generate them. How do I build a PSSM/select sequences to be used for my next iteration? To select sequences to be included in building the PSSM use the selection tools in the Summary Table tab. By default all results with an Expect score lower than the threshold will be selected, but you can manually modify this. Once you have selected the sequences click the \"Run next iteration\" button to build a PSSM from those selected sequences and to run PSI-Search with that PSSM. How do the fixed scale/dynamic scale options work in the visual results? Fixed scale produces a bar with an Expect score from 0 to 100. Dynamic sets the left most of the bar to the smallest Expect score seen in the results, to the right most of the largest Expect score seen. How long are results stored at EMBL-EBI? Results are stored at EMBL-EBI for a week from the date of job submission. What do the alignment symbols mean? The exact format depends on the format selected on the input form, but by default: : (colon) represents an identical match . (period) represents a similar match (BLOSUM50 value greater than or equal to 0) - (hyphen) represents a gap in the sequence X represents part of the sequence that was filtered for low complexity. Why do I get a 'Raw Tool Output' page? This happens when we can't parse the results of your PSI-Search job - usually because the job has failed for some reason. Have a look at the links on the page, especially the Tool Error Details, for clues as to why this might have happened, and check your input for errors. Why do I get a 'Job not found' page? This happens when we can't find the job that you have requested.

RADAR - Rapid Automatic Detection and Alignment of Repeats in protein sequences - is a tool to identify short composition biased and gapped approximate repeats, as well as complex repeat architectures involving many different types of repeats in a query sequence. Why is RADAR useful? RADAR is useful because many large proteins have evolved by internal duplication and many internal sequence repeats correspond to functional and structural units. What version of RADAR is run at the EBI website? For the precise version number of RADAR being run please go to the submission details tab from your job results. How do I reference use of RADAR at the EBI website? Please cite use of RADAR with the following: Rapid automatic detection and alignment of repeats in protein sequences.

The program accepts a single protein sequence in a recognised sequence format. The full list of sequence formats accepted as input is given in this table: EMBOSS sequence formats The sequence can either be pasted into the web form or uploaded to the web form in a file. Is there a limit on the number of sequences or the size of the file that I submit to RADAR? The input for RADAR is limited to 1 sequence or to a 10KB file (whichever is smaller). For batch runs of RADAR see our programmatic access or use the stand-alone version of RADAR. Where can I find information on the different parameters/options? There are no user configurable parameters for RADAR. What output does RADAR produce? RADAR returns a set of multiple alignments corresponding to different types of repeats found in the protein sequence. Summary information about the repeat can be found at the top of each multiple alignment: No. of Repeats: the number of repeat units in this repeat. This corresponds to the number of lines in the multiple alignment. Total Score: the total score of all repeat units in the multiple alignment. For the calculation of this score, a profile is calculated for the repeat and every repeat unit is scored against the profile. The total score is the sum of the individual scores. Length: the (estimated) length of one repeat unit. Diagonal: the offset of the suboptimal alignment used for calculating the template repeat unit. The diagonal is usually roughly equal to the length of the repeat, but doesn't necessarily have to be so. For example in non-contiguous repeats, the repeat length is shorter than the offset of two repeats (i.e. the diagonal). BW-From: the first residue of the template repeat unit. BW-To: the last residue of the template repeat unit. Multiple alignment information: from-to: (Score/Z-Score) alignment. from/to: numbers of the first/last residue. Score: the score of this repeat unit, when scored against the profile of the whole repeat. Z-Score: number of standard-deviations of the score above the mean for shuffled sequences scored against the same profile. How do I download the outputs? The output as text can be downloaded by clicking the view/download button in the Summary tab. Colours will not be preserved in the text file, but some browsers will preserve them if you copy/paste the text from the website. How long are results stored at the EBI? Results are stored at the EBI for a week from the date of job submission. What do the colours mean? The residues are coloured according to their physicochemical properties: Residue Colour Property AVFPMILW RED Small (small+ hydrophobic (incl.aromatic -Y)) DE BLUE Acidic RK MAGENTA Basic - H STYHCNGQ GREEN Hydroxyl + sulfhydryl + amine + G Others GRAY Unusual amino/imino acids etc Why do I get a 'Raw Tool Output' page?

EMBOSS - European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite - is a collection of useful tools for molecular biology. More information can be found at the EMBOSS home page . Why is EMBOSS Transeq useful? Translating nucleic acid sequences into peptide sequences can reveal information about the reading frame and allow further analysis on the possible peptide. Top How can I use EMBOSS Transeq? The EMBOSS Transeq web form is available here . There are two ways to use this service at the EBI. The first is interactively (default) and the second is by email. Using it interactively, the user must wait for the results to be displayed in the browser window. The email option means that the results will not be displayed in the browser window but instead a link to the results will be sent by email. The email option is the better one to take when submitting large amounts of data or a job that might take a long time to run.

The full list of sequence formats accepted as input by EMBOSS tools is given in this table: EMBOSS sequence formats The sequences can either be pasted into the web form or uploaded to the web form in a file. How do I input multiple sequences into a single box? Paste the sequences in an accepted format into the same box: EMBOSS Transeq accepts multiple sequence formats as input - these formats allow for multiple sequences to be placed in the same file or input box, as they each contain ways for EMBOSS Transeq to distinguish where new sequences start. It is important to use correctly formated sequences for this reason. Is there a limit on the number of sequences or the size of the file that I submit to EMBOSS Transeq? The input for EMBOSS Transeq is limited to a maximum of 500 sequences or to a 1MB file (whichever is smaller). For batch runs of EMBOSS Transeq see our programmatic access page Where can I find information on the different parameters/options? Clicking on the parameter names will take you to the relevant help information. Additional parameters can be adjusted by clicking on the more options button. What outputs does EMBOSS Transeq produce? EMBOSS Transeq outputs a single translated text file in FASTA format. How do I download the translation? The quickest way to download the alignment is to click the 'Download Alignment File' button in the alignments tab of the results. Colours are not saved as part of the file. You can also copy/paste the text, in which case colours might be preserved, depending on your browser. Why is the translation/frame different from another tool I'm using?
