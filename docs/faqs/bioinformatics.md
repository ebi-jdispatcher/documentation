### How many sequences can I align at once?
Each tool has its own limit, please refer to the relevant webform page for individual tools.
The EBI service has limits and therefore a smaller number of very long sequences will often stop before an 
alignment is completed. 
Our tool algorithms are NOT intended to produce genome synteny maps.

### What input formats can I use?
Each tool has different requirements, however GCG, FASTA, EMBL (Nucleotide only), 
GenBank, PIR, NBRF, PHYLIP or UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (Protein only) formats can be used in the majority of tools. 
Please refer to the individual tool input pages.
Incorrect input format is one of the most common reasons for job failure.

### How do I download an alignment?
The quickest way to download the alignment is to click the 
'Download Alignment File' button in the alignments tab of the results. 
You can view all the files that are produced on the 'Results Summary' tab, 
which includes the tool output and any guide tree files as well as the alignment file.

### How do I save a coloured alignment?
There are several ways in which to save your colour file.

1. Most obvious is to screenshot the alignment from the output and print to pdf or save as a high res image.
2. Once you have your results, select result summary and if your browser allows the link to Jalview, 
you can use this tool to present many colour formats and save as pdf, png, etc. 
If your browser does not allow the link you can go to the Jalview website and use the tool from there.
3. The EMBOSS suite of tools includes Prettyplot which can be used to download, colour and save alignments 
to either pdf or png. We do not host this service at the EBI and are unable to provide user support for this.
4. For more colouring options you could choose to run Mview
